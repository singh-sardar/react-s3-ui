# Minio S3 Explorer

A web-based UI for browsing and managing files and folders in any S3-compatible object storage service, such as Minio. This application is built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

* **S3-Compatible Connectivity:** Connect to any Minio or other S3-compatible object storage service.

* **Connection Management:** Save, load, and delete multiple connection configurations, which are stored securely in your browser's local storage.

* **Bucket & Folder Navigation:** Seamlessly browse through buckets and nested folders.

* **File & Folder Operations:**

  * Upload files to any folder.

  * Download individual files.

  * Delete multiple files and folders (including all their contents) at once.

* **Instant Search:** A search bar to quickly filter items in the current directory.

* **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js:** Version 18.x or newer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Minio Server:** A running Minio instance or other S3-compatible service. The UI is pre-configured to connect to a local Minio server, but you will need to ensure its CORS policy allows requests from your local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Local Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd minio-explorer-ui
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

Open your terminal in the project root and run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start the Development Server**

Finally, run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to the application, or you can navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or whichever port is shown in your terminal). You can now connect to your Minio instance and start exploring!
